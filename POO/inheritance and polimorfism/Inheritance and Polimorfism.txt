Inheritance

- "Inherits something"
- "Parent and child"
- Allows one or more class(es) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class
- We have a parent class:
	- Product - attributes and its methods
		- Snack (child)
		- Beverage (child)

ADVANTAGES OF USING INHERITANCE:
-> Helps with code organization, security and structure
-> Allows capturing real-world relationships between objects

HOW TO USE: extends

1 - Create the model class or superclass (parent)
2 - Create the derived class(es) (children)
3 - In derived classes don't forget EXTENDS
4 - Apply inheritance ESPECIALLY in the constructor method
5 - Make the superclass ABSTRACT

================================================================

POLYMORPHISM

-> "Many forms"
-> Allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, as long as they share a common INTERFACE
-> Classes implement the same INTERFACE or inherit from the same base class.

INHERITANCE 		VS 		POLYMORPHISM
"Inherits attributes and methods"		"Changes the form"
Constructor method			Does not have a constructor method
General methods				General methods - without implementation
EXTENDS					IMPLEMENTS
